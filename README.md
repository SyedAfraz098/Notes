ðŸ“˜ Serialization & Deserialization â€” Notes
ðŸ”¹ Your Core Points (Simplified & Structured)

Scenario:
When two systems (like frontend and backend) are built using different languages or environments, they need a common way to exchange data.

Example:

Frontend â†’ written in JavaScript

Backend â†’ written in Java, Python, or Rust

When data is sent from frontend to server, and again from server to frontend,
both sides must follow a common serialization standard â€”
so that each side can parse (understand) the data correctly.
To exchange data properly, they must agree on a common data format for serialization

ðŸ”¹ Definition
Serialization:
The process of converting data or objects into a common format for transmission or storage.

Deserialization:
The process of converting that common format back into usable data or objects.

ðŸ”¹ Common Serialization Standards

The most common standard for client-server (HTTP) communication â†’ JSON

Other text-based formats: XML, YAML

| Format                                                         | Type       | Common Use                                                   | Example                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**                          | Text-based | Most common for web (HTTP) communication                     | `{ "name": "Alex", "age": 25 }`                   |
| **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**                           | Text-based | Used in web services, configuration files                    | `<person><name>Alex</name><age>25</age></person>` |
| **YAML (YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language)**                          | Text-based | Easier to read for configs                                   | `name: Alex  age: 25`                             |
| **Binary formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers, Avro, MessagePack)** | Binary     | Faster & smaller in size (used in performance-critical apps) | (Machine-readable binary)                         |
